From the included assets in the project file code the website of a coffee shot.
Your site must be based on the primary brand colors, but I recommend choosing a new off white rather than F0E9F0, which is a pink-white.
# html
Each page in your site should have your name in the appropriate meta tag
Remove the color swatches from the main page.

# css
Use a single css file to style each of the pages included in the project files.
Use comments to help you organize your code.
Be responsive.
The about page and contact us pages have a current class in their menu to provide a breadcrumb for the user, come up with a visually distinct way to represent this within the navigation menu.
The headings on the contact menu should be smaller than the h1 on other portions of the site.
The divs containing the different ways to contact should be styled as blocks.
The first word in each paragraph of the about page should be highlighted and a different color than the rest of the text.
The menu should have a visual hierarchy.
Each items price should have a dollar sign in front of it. Add this in CSS not HTML.
# JavaScript
Create a menu from the definitional lists with buttons that only shows selected
  In addition make it so that the menu has buttons that show and hide the parts of the menu that the user might want to look.
    Use javascript for this.
  Create a way to highlight specials either using css or javascript
